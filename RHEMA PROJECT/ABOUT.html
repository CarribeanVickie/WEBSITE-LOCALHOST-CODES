    <img class="logo" src="images/a.jpg" alt="Rhema Word Embassy Church LOGO">
    <p>To be changed by Truth and become<br>agents of change in our generation</p>
    <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
    <p>declare, communicate, share and<br>demonstrate the purpose, power and<br>principles of the Kingdom of God to<br>every nation</p>
    <h1>OUR MISSION STRATEGY</h1>
    <h2>Accurate Focus;</h2>
    <p>If you embrace and value your
    commitment to YOUR SALVATION
    AND CALLING, then you will not
    scatter it loosely to just any place or
    just anybody.</p>
    <p>Rhema Word Embassy Church has
    a predetermined attention on areas
    of our assignment bestowed upon
    us by Jesus Christ who is the head
    of His church (Ephe 1:22; 5:23; Col
    1:18):</p>
    <h2>Strong leadership;</h2>
    <p>Every achievement or success is
    tied to the success of leadership.
    Leadership is cultured through
    training.</p>
    <p>Developing and establishing a
    strong, all round trained leadership
    is our key goal in our ministry focus.</p>
    <h1><i>Obeying</i> OUR CALL<br>as Believers in Jesus Christ</h1>
    <p>Before Jesus sent the twelve, he fed them and trained them three and a half years. He has commissioned us the Church to:</p>
    <h2>Feed the flock;</h2>
    <p>Productivity, future, prosperity
    and strength is a result of a a well
    fed and healthy flock. As Jesus
    admonished Apostle Peter to feed
    the flock; John 21:15-17 that becomes
    our commitment</p>
    <p>Before dealing with others, we are
    the priority; Mathew 7:3
    </p>
    <p>The strength, stability and
    durability of a building is as good as
    its foundation; Mathew 7:24-27
    </p>
    <h2>Influence the environment;</h2>
    <p>Once transformed you will not
    conform to the world but you will
    influence; Romans 12:1-2,
    </p>
    <p>We will light up the world around us
    and beyond once we are lighted up;
    Mathew 5:14
    </p>
    <p>We will bring divine taste affect all
    as the salt; Mathew 5:13
    </p>
    <h2>Reach out to the world;</h2>
    <p>In obedience to Jesusâ€™ commission
    we will keep engaged in outreach
    missions for the unreached; Mathew
    28:18-20
    </p>
    <p>We shall remain engaged with the
    world as the sons of God eagerly
    awaited to be manifested; Romans
    8:1
    </p>
    <p>The world will come calling; let us
    go to the house of the God of Israel
    and hear what He will tell us that we
    may obey him; Isaiah 2:3 ; Micah 4:2
    </p>
    <p>The word of God shall go forth from
    this house as the pillar and ground
    of truth; 1Timothy 3:15
    </p>
    <h2>Reach out to the body of Christ;</h2>
    <p>Have envisaged to establish a multisectoral
    facility which will serve as
    the training centre to reproduce
    focused and effective ministers
    through; teachings, trainings,
    equipping and empowering
    individuals to discover, develop,
    actualize and maximize the
    potential of their inherent gifts and 
    purposes. 2Timothy 2:15</p>
