    <p>In Our Church We Believe;<br>1.<b>The Scriptures are Inspired</b>
        The Scriptures, both the Old and New Testaments, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct (2 Tim. 3:15-17; 1 Thess.2:13; 2 Peter 1:21).<br>
        2.<b>The One True God</b><br>
        The one true God has revealed himself as the eternally self-existent "I AM," the Creator of heaven and earth and the Redeemer of mankind. He has further revealed himself as embodying the principles of relationship and association as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Deut. 6:4; Isaiah 43:10; Matt.28:19; Luke 3:22).<br>
        3.<b>The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ</b><br>
        The Lord Jesus Christ is the Eternal Son of God. The Scriptures declare:<br>
        a)His virgin birth (Matthew 1:23; Luke 1:31, 35).<br>
        b)His sinless and holy life (Hebrews 7:26; 1 Peter 2:22).<br>
        c)His miracles (Acts 2:22; 10:38).<br>
        d)His redemptive work on the cross (I Cor. 15:3; 2 Cor.5:21).<br>
        e)His bodily resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; Luke 24:39; I Cor. 15:4).<br>
        f)His exaltation to the right hand of God (Acts 1:9, 11; 2:33;Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 1:3).<br>
        4.<b>The Fall of Man</b><br>
        Man was created good and upright; for God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from God (Genesis 1:26, 27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12-19).<br>
        5.<b>The Salvation of Man</b><br>
        Man's only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God.<br>
        a)<em>Conditions to Salvation</em><br>
        Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, being justified by grace through faith, man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of eternal life (Luke 24:47, John 3:3; Romans 10:13-15; Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11; 3:5-7).<br>
        b)<em>Evidence of Salvation</em><br>
        The inward evidence of salvation, righteousness, and holiness and the gifting and manifestation of the fruit of the spirit in the life of believers is the direct witness of the new birth of the Holy Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23, John 16:13, John 3:5-16, Romans 8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Eph. 4:24; Titus 2:12) and walking as one spirit with His Spirit (1 Cor.6:17).<br>
        6.<b>The Ordinances of the Church</b><br>
        a)<em>Baptism in Water</em><br>
        The ordinance of baptism by immersion is commanded in the Scriptures.  All who repent and believe in Jesus Christ as a personal Savior and Lord are to be baptized. Thus they declare to the world that they have died with Christ and that they also have been raised with Him to walk in newness of life. (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47-48; Romans 6:4).<br>
        b)<em>Holy Communion</em><br>
        The Lord's Supper, consisting of the elements, bread and the fruit of the vine, is the symbol expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (2 Peter 1:4); a memorial of His suffering and death (I Cor. 11:26); and a prophecy of His second coming (I Cor. 11:26); and is enjoined on all believers "till He come!"<br>
        7.<b>The Baptism in the Holy Ghost</b><br>
        All believers are entitled to and should ardently expect and earnestly seek the promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Ghost and fire, according to the command of our Lord Jesus Christ. This was the normal experience of all in the early Christian church. With it comes the endowment of power for life and service, the manifestation of speaking in tongues for prayer,  the bestowment of the gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4, 8; I Cor. 12:1-31). This experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of the new birth (Acts 8:12-17); 10:44-46; 11:14-16; 15:7-9). With the baptism in the Holy Ghost come such experiences as an overflowing fullness of the Spirit (John7:37-39; Acts 4:8), a deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:43; Heb. 12:28), an intensified consecration to God and dedication to His work (Acts 2:42), and a more active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost (Mark 16:20).  The baptism of believers in the Holy Ghost is witnessed by the endowment of spiritual gifts (l Cor. 12) (Acts 2) and fruit of Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).<br>
        8.<b>Sanctification</b><br>
        Sanctification is an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication unto God (Rom.12:1-2; I Thess. 5:23; Heb 13:12). The scriptures teach a life of “holiness without which no man shall see the God” (Heb. 12:14). By the power of the Holy Ghost we are able to obey the command "Be ye holy, for I am holy" (I Peter 1:15-16).<br>
        Sanctification is realized in the believer by recognizing his identification with Christ in His death and resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the facts of that union, and by offering every faculty continually to the dominion of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 6:1-11, 13; 8:1,2,13; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 2:12-13; I Peter 1:5).<br>
        9.<b>The Church</b><br>
        The Church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine appointments for fulfillment of her great commission. Each believer, born of the Spirit, is an integral part of the body of Christ, which is written in heaven (Ephesians 1:22-23; 2:22; Hebrews 12:23).<br>
        10.<b>The Ministry</b><br>
        A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for the threefold purpose of leading the Church in:<br>
        (i.) Transformation of the saints being perfected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11-16),<br>
        (ii.) Evangelism of the world (Mark 16:15-20),<br>
        (iii.) Worship of God (John 4:23-24).<br>
        Since God's purpose concerning man is to seek and to save that which is lost, to be worshiped by man, and to build a body of believers in the image of His son, the priority reason-for-being of The Rhema Word Embassy Church is:<br>
        a)To be an agency for transformation of the saints being perfected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11-16).<br>
        b)To be an agent to the body in the worship of God (I Corinthians 12:13).<br>
        c)To be an agency of God for global evangelism (Acts 1:8,Matthew 28:19, 20; Mark 6:15-16).<br>
        11.<b>Divine Healing</b><br>	
        Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the Atonement, and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4-5; Matt. 8:16-17; James 5:14-16).<br>
        12.<b>The Blessed Hope</b><br>
        The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their transformation together with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the Church (I Thess. 4:16-17; Romans 8:23; I Cor. 15:51-52).<br>
        13.<b>The Millennial Reign of Christ</b><br>
        The second coming of Christ includes the rapture of the saints, which is our blessed hope, followed by the visible return of Christ with His saints to reign on the earth for one thousand years (Zech. 14:5; Matt. 24:27,30; Rev. 1:7; 19:11-14; 20:1-6). This millennial reign will bring the salvation of the nation Israel (Ezekiel 37:21-22; Zephaniah 3:19-20; Romans 1:26-27) and the establishment of universal peace (Isaiah 11:6-9, Psalm 72:3-8; Micah 4:3-4).<br>
        14.<b>The Final Judgment</b><br>
        There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together with the devil and his angels, the beast and the false prophet, will be consigned to everlasting punishment in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death (Matt. 25:46; Mark 9:43-48; Rev. 19:20; 20:11-15; 21:8).<br>
        15.<b>The New Heavens and the New Earth</b><br>
        "We according to His promise, look for new heaven and a new earth wherein righteousness dwells (2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1-2)."<br>
        <b>Vision Slogan</b><br>
        <em>“Transforming Followers Into Leaders And Leaders Into Agents Of Change.”</em>
